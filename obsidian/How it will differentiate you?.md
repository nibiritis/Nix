#### What Most people Do?

**1. Limited Exploration**
	a. Most practitioners start with basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) using standard frameworks.
	b. They quickly move on to calling .fit on a model without thoroughly understanding the data.
**2. Basic Model Training**
	a. After EDA, they typically split the data, train a model and call .predict.
	b. The project often ends here with a focus on achieving high accuracy or minimising error.
**3. Lack of Iteration**
	a. Once the model is trained, it's rarely revisited or improved based on deeper insights from the data.
	b. There's minimal to no effort in validating assumptions or handling model violations.

#### MLOps and Production Readiness:
	a. Differentiate our project by integrating MLOps practices using ZenML and MLflow.
	b. Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, deployment of the model in production
	c. Ensure the model is not only accurate but also maintainable, scaleable and ready for real-world use.
