Imagine you run a coffee shop. Customers can order different types of coffee, but the process of making coffee follows a similar pattern. You have a general coffee-making machine (the factory) that can be used to make different types of coffee (products) like Espresso, Latte, or Cappuccino.
- *CoffeeMachine (Factory):* Has a method to make coffee
- *Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino (ConcreteProducts):* Different types of coffee that can be made by the machine.
