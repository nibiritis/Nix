This project is focused on building an end-to-end machine leaning pipeline for  a **"House price prediction system"** 

The pipeline is developed using **ZenML**, a MLOps framework that helps in managing machine learning workflows, and **MLflow**, which is used for experiment tracking and model deployment.

The Primary goal is to predict house prices based on various features of the properties, such as the size, location, and condition.

But everyone is doing house price prediction system.
